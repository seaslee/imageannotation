introduction : It is a simple and stupid tool to do image annotation.
I am learning some thing about Image Progress and Machine learning ,so 
I want to write some thing to learn them.
-----------------------------------------------------
1.Contents.
  1)ExtFt.py : It is mainly to extract features from the image.it can extract 
    color feature and texture feature . In color feature ,we use the color histogram.
    I am a fresh bird in image progress , hence i am use the gray-tone intensity-indepdent matrices.
    For the time waste problem, i have to use matlab to write the texture feature algrothims.
  2)glcm.m  : it's a matlab file . I use this to extract texture feature .
  3)link.py : use this to put the cft(color feature file) and tft(texture feature file together).
  4)svmff.py : format the feature file ,because i will use svmlib.


2.Usage.
